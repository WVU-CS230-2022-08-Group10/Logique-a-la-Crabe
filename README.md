## Welcome to Logique a la Crabe!
Our goal is to teach digital logic in its simplest form.
Each module teaches a fundemental subject related digital logic from the binary number system to transistors and is similar to what you would learn in a college level course. It's simplified greatly so beginners are welcome to start their education as computer engineers!
Our main feature (still in development) is the Circuit Canvas where in the future you can implement your own digital logic designs.

## What is there to do?
There are currently four modules for users to study and complete: Binary Number Systems, Logic Gates, Noise Margins and Transistors. 
Each module has five practice problems and a five question quiz. Don't worry though! You'll still be able to read over the materials if you find yourself stuck on a tricky question!

## Special Note on the Logic Gates Module
The practice and quiz questions (for this module only) need to be answered in numerical order. Your answer will not be counted for other questions until the ones before it are answered so it is similar to the other modules in that regard. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. 

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
